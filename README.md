# Activity Automative

## Student Notes
So... I TRIED to make an index.html file so I can look at the console, but it seems to not really be working. I have followed the activity instructions and still not properly console logging. JS is very tricky and sometimes it can be frustrating, however I feel like I'm kinda sorta getting better at it.

Also on my index.js file I have a "let Vehicle = require('./vehicle').Vehicle" as per looking at the node.js docs on importing the module from the vehicleBaseClass.js file.

## Instructions
- In this lesson students work on sub-classing a base vehicle class
- to do this we need a way of importing / using code from a different file...

[Official Node.js docs](https://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.2/api/modules.html#all_Together...)

(NOTE: You'll write your derived Car class in a file you make called index.js.)
